# About me
Hi, I'm Sander. I'm a former student of DAE: Game development, I also have some experience in University of Antwerp: Computer Science prior to that. My dream is to work as a game developer and some day launch my own studio to make memorable experiences for at least a couple thousend of people. At this point in my life I am still young and want to Gradually hone my skills, learn new ones and most of all create interesting experiences in that process.

# Why was this project made?
This project came to be because I love making games and I want to grow my protfolio to land potential future jobs. I am motivated to prove myself worthy through doing what I love doing, making games. This genre is a personal interest of mine. The art style and 2D aspect were chosen to hone my skills in this department as I am less familiar with it and the time to create them and code features for them is managable within the timeframe I set for myself which was 3 weeks.

# Who helped make this project?
I have had friends playtest the alpha build, later on I have had a beta go out to the public and all of their support and feedback is invaluable. When it comes to the core development team, everything was created and designed by myself.

# The game
The game will be a 2D top down, fantasy roguelike with an item system not too disimilar too risk of rain 2. The controls will be similar to the league of legends moba. The player will have to fight through endless waves of enemies leading up to a boss fight. The game keeps going untill you beat the bossfight, but the boss fight is a deliberate descission. The player get's the option to fight the boss every couple of rounds or so (tbd). The player will have a choice between two characters on launch, each having different abilities, and stats. In contrast to Risk of rain 2, I do not want people to be able to get a build that allows them to just run and clear most of the adds if not everything. Which leads me to my next paragraph.

 Why that control scheme you might wonder. Well to me the combat in league of legends I think is partially as good as it is because of that exact control scheme. The player needs to use often precise aiming and fast clicks and flicks of the mouse to not only attack but move also. they are fairly hectic, fast inputs that keeps the player on their toes. I'm interested in playing around with it and making it stay impactfull and engaging even at later stages of the game making it so the control scheme and combat system synergise well to make satisfying powerfull moves depending on your build.

The main focus of this project was to start with a small indie project where I could practice and maintain structured and scalable code. A roguelike within the fantasy genre is perfect for this as a lot of items can scale on various player data or even beahavior, so managing your code well is paramount to making your life easier down the line in this type of game.

I chose to only include one level instead of multiple due to timeconstraints. As this was a project for me to learn new things I find that level design is not the main focus of this project and therefor multiple maps also doesn't fit within the scope of the project.

Although making my own sounds was something I really want to learn for future projects, getting the basics down was the only goal within this project.
